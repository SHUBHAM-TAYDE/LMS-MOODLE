# Moodle on Ubuntu (EC2) â€” Add 50GB EBS Volume & Move Data
Complete, step-by-step `README.md` to attach a 50GB EBS volume, mount it at `/mnt/data`, move Moodle web files and `moodledata`, make the mount persistent, and optionally move MySQL data. Copy-paste this file into your GitHub repo.

## Summary
This guide helps you free up a full root volume by moving Moodle application files and user data to a new 50GB EBS volume mounted at `/mnt/data`. It includes safe backups, verification steps, permission fixes, fstab persistence, optional MySQL data migration, cleanup tips and rollback steps.

**Assumptions**
- Ubuntu on AWS EC2 (you have console access).
- You have `sudo` privileges on the instance.
- Web server: Apache or Nginx + PHP (adjust service names if different).
- New EBS device expected at `/dev/xvdf` (or similar).

**Important:** Take backups before starting. Expect a short maintenance window while files are moved.

## 0. (Strongly Recommended) Create Snapshots/Backups

Before changes, create at least a DB and web files backup.
```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h

# List block devices
lsblk

# Backup web files quickly to the new disk (if already mounted)
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data/backups
sudo tar -C /var/www/html -czf /mnt/data/backups/moodle-www-$(date +%F).tar.gz moodle

# Backup DB (adjust user/password/db)
mysqldump -u root -p YOUR_MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD moodle > /mnt/data/backups/moodle-db-$(date +%F).sql
```
Also consider an EBS snapshot of the root volume from the AWS Console.
